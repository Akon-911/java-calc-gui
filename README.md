## About This Project

`v0.1` - January 01, 2025

This is a simple GUI Calculator, I am just trying to demonstrate how much I could do with Java UI without using external help (incl. StackOverFlow, AI Generated code) in order to get better understanding on how to work with Frontend using Java.

In Future updates, I will try to make it better

## Libraries used

`Swing`  - w/ JFrame for UI

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.
